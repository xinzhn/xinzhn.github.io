# Xin Zhang

I am currently a PhD candidate in the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.maths.unsw.edu.au) at the University of New South Wales. My supervisor is [A/Prof. Scott Sisson](http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~scott). I am also affiliated to the Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers ([ACEMS](http://acems.org.au)). My research is in the intersection of statistics and machine learning. In particular, I am interested in symbolic data analysis, scalable algorithms for Bayesian computation (e.g. MCMC & SMC) and Bayesian nonparametric models.
