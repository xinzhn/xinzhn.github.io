**Bio**

I am a PhD student in the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.maths.unsw.edu.au) at the University of New South Wales ([UNSW](https://www.unsw.edu.au)). My supervisor is A/Prof. [Scott Sisson](http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~scott). I am also affiliated to the Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers ([ACEMS](http://acems.org.au)). My research is in the intersection of statistics and machine learning. I am currently interested in developing probabilistic models for analysing datasets with complex structures, and designing scalable Bayesian computation algorithms for challenging large-scale models.
